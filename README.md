# Overview

This is just a simple "Hello World" program that was created as a first assignment as a set up GitHub, VS Code, and everything else needed for this module.

# Development Environment

I wrote the code in VS Code, and used the C++ language. This is the first time for me using C++, so I combined this project with the first module.

# Useful Websites

To be honest, learning a new programming language, the most useful sources are YouTube tutorials and chatGPT, that can explain everything in the code in detail that I don't understand, and can easily translate between programming languages.
